A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a name and location.

Parameter Locations
There are four possible parameter locations specified by the in field:

    path - Used together with Path Templating, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation’s URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path parameter is itemId.
    query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.
    header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230] states header names are case insensitive.
    cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.

The rules for serialization of the parameter are specified in one of two ways. For simpler scenarios, a schema and style can describe the structure and syntax of the parameter.

For more complex scenarios, the content property can define the media type and schema of the parameter. A parameter MUST contain either a schema property, or a content property, but not both. When example or examples are provided in conjunction with the schema object, the example MUST follow the prescribed serialization strategy for the parameter."))

Together, this information forms a dialect. Any vocabulary that is understood by the implementation MUST be processed in a manner consistent with the semantic definitions contained within the vocabulary. The value of this keyword MUST be an object. The property names in the object MUST be URIs (containing a scheme) and this URI MUST be normalized.

It is not currently possible to distinguish between unrecognized keywords that are defined in vocabularies from those that are not part of any vocabulary. The \"$vocabulary\" keyword SHOULD be used in the root schema of any schema document intended for use as a meta-schema. It MUST NOT appear in subschemas.

This URI-reference SHOULD be normalized, and MUST resolve to an absolute-URI [RFC3986] (without a fragment), or to a URI with an empty fragment. The empty fragment form is NOT RECOMMENDED and is retained only for backwards compatibility, and because the application/schema+json media type defines that a URI with an empty fragment identifies the same resource as the same URI with the fragment removed. However, since this equivalence is not part of the RFC 3986 normalization process [RFC3986], implementers and schema authors cannot rely on generic URI libraries understanding it. Therefore, \"$id\" MUST NOT contain a non-empty fragment, and SHOULD NOT contain an empty fragment. The absolute-URI form MUST be considered the canonical URI, regardless of the presence or absence of an empty fragment. An empty fragment is currently allowed because older meta-schemas have an empty fragment in their $id (or previously, id). A future draft may outright forbid even empty fragments in \"$id\". The absolute-URI also serves as the base URI for relative URI-references in keywords within the schema resource, in accordance with RFC 3986 section 5.1.1 [RFC3986] regarding base URIs embedded in content. The presence of \"$id\" in a subschema indicates that the subschema constitutes a distinct schema resource within a single schema document. Furthermore, in accordance with RFC 3986 section 5.1.2 [RFC3986] regarding encapsulating entities, if an \"$id\" in a subschema is a relative URI-reference, the base URI for resolving that reference is the URI of the parent schema resource.

They are identifier keywords that can only be used to create plain name fragments, rather than absolute URIs as seen with \"$id\". The base URI to which the resulting fragment is appended is the canonical URI of the schema resource containing the \"$anchor\" or \"$dynamicAnchor\" in question.

See the section on \"$dynamicRef\" (Section 8.2.3.2) for details.

Together with \"$dynamicAnchor\", \"$dynamicRef\" implements a cooperative extension mechanism that is primarily useful with recursive schemas (schemas that reference themselves). Both the extension point and the runtime-determined extension target are defined with \"$dynamicAnchor\", and only exhibit runtime dynamic behavior when referenced with \"$dynamicRef\". The value of the \"$dynamicRef\" property MUST be a string which is a URI-Reference. Resolved against the current URI base, it produces the URI used as the starting point for runtime resolution. This initial resolution is safe to perform on schema load. If the initially resolved starting point URI includes a fragment that was created by the \"$dynamicAnchor\" keyword, the initial URI MUST be replaced by the URI (including the fragment) for the outermost schema resource in the dynamic scope (Section 7.1) that defines an identically named fragment with \"$dynamicAnchor\".
Otherwise, its behavior is identical to \"$ref\", and no runtime resolution is needed.")

For more information about the properties, see JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation.

Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow those of JSON Schema and do not add any additional semantics. Where JSON Schema indicates that behavior is defined by the application (e.g. for annotations), OAS also defers the definition of semantics to the application consuming the OpenAPI document.

Properties

The OpenAPI Schema Object dialect is defined as requiring the OAS base vocabulary, in addition to the vocabularies as specified in the JSON Schema draft 2020-12 general purpose meta-schema.

The OpenAPI Schema Object dialect for this version of the specification is identified by the URI https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/dialect/base (the “OAS dialect schema id”).

The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema specification but their definitions have been extended by the OAS:

    - description - CommonMark syntax MAY be used for rich text representation.
    - format - See Data Type Formats for further details. While relying on JSON Schema’s defined formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.

In addition to the JSON Schema properties comprising the OAS dialect, the Schema Object supports keywords from any other vocabularies, or entirely arbitrary properties.

Composition and Inheritance (Polymorphism)

The OpenAPI Specification allows combining and extending model definitions using the allOf property of JSON Schema, in effect offering model composition. allOf takes an array of object definitions that are validated independently but together compose a single object.

While composition offers model extensibility, it does not imply a hierarchy between the models. To support polymorphism, the OpenAPI Specification adds the discriminator field. When used, the discriminator will be the name of the property that decides which schema definition validates the structure of the model. As such, the discriminator field MUST be a required field. There are two ways to define the value of a discriminator for an inheriting instance.

    - Use the schema name.
    - Override the schema name by overriding the property with a new value. If a new value exists, this takes precedence over the schema name. As such, inline schema definitions, which do not have a given id, cannot be used in polymorphism."))

When using the discriminator, inline schemas will not be considered.
